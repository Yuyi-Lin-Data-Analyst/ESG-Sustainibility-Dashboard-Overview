> By providing a data-driven, comprehensive view of emissions, this dashboard becomes an essential tool for integrating sustainability into core business strategy, improving operational efficiency, managing risks, and driving continuous improvement in environmental performance.

<br />

## North Star Metric 
Total Emission (mtCO2e)
> This is the primary metric the company is tracking, as it represents the overall carbon footprint of the organization.

<br />

## Dimensions
- Emission Scopes - Scope 1.2.3
- Time Periods - Monthly tracking and Year-over-year comparison
- Organizational Units

<br />

## Primary Goals of the Dashboard
The emissions dashboard's primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive view of the company's greenhouse gas emissions. It aims to track performance against reduction targets, facilitate data-driven decision-making for sustainability initiatives, and support compliance with environmental regulations. By offering clear insights into emission trends across different scopes and time periods, the dashboard enables effective management of the organization's environmental impact and informs strategic sustainability planning.

<br />


## Key Functions
1. Emissions Quantification:

- Displays total emissions and breakdowns by Scope 1, 2, and 3
- Shows emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mtCO2e)

<br />

2. Year-over-Year Comparisons:

- Calculates and displays percentage changes in emissions compared to the previous year

<br />

3. Goal Tracking:

- Shows progress towards emission reduction goals (YoY Goal Track)
- Displays the emission goal in mtCO2e

<br />

4. Time Series Analysis:

- Provides a line graph of monthly emissions throughout the year
- Offers a bar chart comparing monthly emissions across two years

<br />

5. Organizational Filtering:

- Allows selection of specific organizational units (e.g., Contoso London)

<br />

6. Target Setting:

- Displays the target decrease percentage

<br />

7. Scope-based Analysis:

- Breaks down emissions by Scope 1, 2, and 3 in both numerical and visual formats
